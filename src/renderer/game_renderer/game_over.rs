//! Game over overlay rendering system.
//!
//! This module provides a complete game over screen rendering system that
//! displays a semitransparent red overlay when the player loses. The overlay
//! covers the entire screen and can include animated effects based on time.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - **Fullscreen Overlay**: Covers the entire viewport with semitransparent red
//! - **Time-Based Animation**: Supports animated effects using uniform time data
//! - **Alpha Blending**: Proper transparency for overlay effect
//! - **GPU-Efficient**: Single draw call with fullscreen quad
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```rust
//! // Create game over renderer
//! let game_over = GameOverRenderer::new(device, surface_config);
//!
//! // Update animation time
//! game_over.update_time(queue, elapsed_time);
//!
//! // Render overlay (after game scene)
//! game_over.render(&mut render_pass, window);
//! ```
//!
//! # Shader Requirements
//!
//! The game over shader should be located at `../shaders/game-over.wgsl` and
//! expect a uniform binding for time-based animation effects.
//!
//! # Visual Effect
//!
//! The overlay creates a "red screen of death" effect that clearly indicates
//! the game has ended while still allowing the player to see the final game
//! state underneath.

/// Uniform data for game over animation timing.
///
/// This struct contains the time data sent to the GPU shader for
/// animated effects in the game over overlay. The data is packed to
/// match GPU memory alignment requirements.
///
/// # Memory Layout
///
/// - `time`: Animation time in seconds (typically elapsed time since game over)
/// - `_padding`: Ensures proper GPU memory alignment (16-byte boundary)
///
/// # Usage in Shader
///
/// The shader can use this time value for effects like:
/// - Pulsing/fading animations
/// - Color transitions
/// - Particle effects
/// - Screen shake or distortion
#[repr(C)]

struct GameOverUniforms {
    /// Animation time in seconds.
    ///
    /// This value is typically the elapsed time since the game over
    /// state began, allowing for continuous animation effects.
    time: f32,

    /// Padding for GPU memory alignment requirements.

/// Game over overlay renderer for end-game visual effects.
///
/// This struct manages the complete game over rendering system, including
/// shader pipeline setup, uniform management, and fullscreen overlay rendering.
/// The renderer creates a semitransparent red overlay that clearly indicates
/// the game has ended while preserving visibility of the final game state.
///
/// # Rendering Approach
///
/// The game over renderer uses a simple but effective approach:
/// - **Fullscreen Quad**: Single quad covering entire viewport
/// - **Fragment Shader**: Handles color, transparency, and animation effects
/// - **Alpha Blending**: Enables semitransparent overlay effect
/// - **Time Uniform**: Provides animation timing for dynamic effects
///
/// # Performance Characteristics
///
/// - **GPU Memory**: Minimal - single vertex buffer and uniform buffer
/// - **CPU Usage**: Negligible - only uniform updates
/// - **Rendering**: Single draw call per frame
/// - **Memory Footprint**: Very small and constant
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// This struct is not thread-safe and should only be accessed from the
/// main rendering thread.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// # use crate::renderer::game_renderer::game_over::GameOverRenderer;
/// # let device: wgpu::Device = unimplemented!();
/// # let surface_config: wgpu::SurfaceConfiguration = unimplemented!();
/// # let queue: wgpu::Queue = unimplemented!();
///
/// let game_over = GameOverRenderer::new(&device, &surface_config);
///
/// // During game over state
/// let elapsed = start_time.elapsed().as_secs_f32();
/// game_over.update_time(&queue, elapsed);
/// game_over.render(&mut render_pass, window);
/// ```

    ///
    /// The game over shader should be located at `../maze/game-over.wgsl`

    ///
    /// The renderer starts with time = 0.0. Use [`update_time()`](GameOverRenderer::update_time)
    /// to animate the overlay effect.

    /// # Parameters
    ///
    /// - `device` - WGPU device for creating GPU resources
    /// - `surface_config` - Surface configuration (provides target format)

    /// # Returns
    ///
