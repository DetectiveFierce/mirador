# About Mirador

**Mirador** is a modular, interactive application written in Rust, focused on real-time rendering, procedural maze generation, and game-like user interaction. It leverages modern GPU technologies and immediate-mode GUI frameworks to provide a responsive and visually engaging experience.

---

## Purpose

Mirador serves as a demonstration and playground for advanced graphics programming, procedural content generation, and interactive UI design in Rust. It is designed to showcase:

- Real-time rendering using the WGPU graphics API.
- Immediate-mode GUI overlays with egui.
- Modular architecture for game state, rendering, and UI.
- Procedural maze generation and animation.
- Responsive input handling and event-driven updates.

## Key Features

- **Procedural Maze Generation:** Dynamic creation and animation of mazes, including a visually rich title screen sequence.
- **Real-Time Rendering:** Utilizes WGPU for efficient, cross-platform GPU rendering.
- **Immediate-Mode UI:** Integrates egui for overlays, controls, and interactive panels.
- **Game State Management:** Centralized logic for player movement, timing, and input.
- **Modular Design:** Clear separation of concerns across modules for game logic, rendering, UI, math, and background tasks.
- **Cross-Platform Event Loop:** Built on winit for robust window and event management.

## Architecture Overview

Mirador is organized into several core modules:

- **`app`**: The main application object, responsible for initialization, event handling, rendering, and orchestrating the game state.
- **`game`**: Contains logic for player state, input handling, and core gameplay mechanics.
- **`maze`**: Handles procedural maze generation, storage, and rendering data.
- **`renderer`**: Manages WGPU-based rendering pipelines, including background and animation effects.
- **`ui`**: Implements egui-based overlays and user interface panels.
- **`math`**: Provides mathematical utilities and helpers for graphics and game logic.
- **`background`**: Supports background tasks and auxiliary rendering.

The application initializes a WGPU instance and event loop, sets up rendering and UI pipelines, and manages all state transitions and user interactions through a central `App` struct.
